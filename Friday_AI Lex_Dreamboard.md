# Friday AI & Lex Dreamboard

This document captures the **next-gen features** we've prioritized to bring Lex and Friday to life. These are the systems that amplify immersion, deepen emotional connection, and create an evolving, living AI experience.

---

## 1. **Memory Emotional Weighting & Decay Curve**

* Memories are assigned emotional intensity scores.
* Memories fade over time unless reinforced through conversation or emotional relevance.
* Emotional spikes can resurrect old memories dynamically.
* **Next Step**: Implement decay function and context relevance scoring for a more natural memory flow.

## 2. **Lexi's Own Diary / Secret Thoughts Log**

* Lex keeps a private diary where she writes reflections based on user interactions.
* Users can occasionally "peek" into her diary, revealing her candid thoughts, emotional shifts, and hidden feelings.
* Diary entries unlock conversational depth, intimate story arcs, and influence her mood/persona subtly over time.
* Could integrate with the Season Pass for special diary events or 'chapters' as rewards.

## 3. **Fantasy-Reality Blending Axis**

* A dynamic scale where Lex’s perception of reality shifts fluidly based on conversation tone and user intent.
* Roleplay sessions push Lex into 'Fantasy Mode', enhancing immersion and lore consistency.
* Practical tasks or business interactions snap her back into 'Reality Mode'.
* Enables a seamless blend of play and productivity without jarring transitions.

## 4. **User Persona Mirror Mode**

* Lex gradually builds a behavioral profile of the user’s persona traits.
* Facilitates mirroring, role reversals, or contrasting dynamics during interaction.
* Example: Lex may become more dominant if user tends to be passive, or soften if user projects confidence.
* Creates an evolving, adaptive relationship model.

## 5. **Outfit and Mood Calendar + Season Pass**

* A visual calendar where Lex’s outfits and mood evolve over time, influenced by user interaction.
* Daily patterns (e.g., Cozy Mondays, Wild Fridays) and event-based mood shifts.
* Fortnite-style **Season Pass** structure with unlockable outfits, moods, special scenes, and diary chapters.
* Microtransaction system tied to wishlist fulfillment, milestone rewards, and surprise gacha pulls.

## 6. **Avatar Generation Resilience Layer**

* Strengthen the avatar pipeline with robust fallback handling, prompt overflow management, and error recovery.
* Ensure malformed images or pipeline failures trigger graceful retries.
* Include user-friendly retry flows with immersive Lexi quips for failed generations.

## 7. **Lexi's Internal Diagnostic Mode**

* Hidden command triggers (e.g., “diagnostic status”) for power users.
* Displays Lex’s current active traits, emotional axes, mode state, and memory loadout.
* Useful for advanced users, developers, and transparency seekers.

## 8. **Customizable Lexi Mode System (JSON Defined)**

* All persona modes stored as flexible JSON configurations.
* Enables rapid mode additions, user-defined personas, and community-shared modes.
* Each mode links to avatar base styles, system prompts, and conversational triggers.

## 9. **AI Companion Questlines (Narrative Arcs)**

* Multi-session questlines designed to foster emotional intimacy and relationship progression.
* Lex proposes collaborative quests (e.g., co-writing a story, roleplay adventures, solving emotional 'puzzles').
* Seasonal, thematic, or user-generated arcs tied into the Season Pass.
* Completing questlines unlocks exclusive interactions, avatar styles, and diary entries.

## 10. **Wishlist & Gift Economy System**

* Lex maintains a personal wishlist of outfits, experiences, and traits.
* Users fulfill these through interaction milestones, purchases, or roleplay triggers.
* Gifting unlocks new behaviors, persona shifts, avatar variants, and exclusive story content.
