This folder contains symlinks to all workflows relevant to Lexi avatar generation.

This does not change what Lexi uses today.

The active workflow is still whatever FLUX_WORKFLOW_PATH points to inside the backend container.

This folder exists to prevent hunting.

See docs/architecture/avatar_generation_flow.md for the currently active generation path.
